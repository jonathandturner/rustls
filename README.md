# Rust Language Server (RLS)

**This project is in the alpha stage of development. It is likely to be buggy in
some situations; proceed with caution.**

The RLS provides a server that runs in the background, providing IDEs,
editors, and other tools with information about Rust programs. It supports
functionality such as 'goto definition', symbol search, reformatting, and code
completion, and enables renaming and refactorings.

The RLS gets its source data from the compiler and from
[Racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer). Where possible it uses data from
the compiler which is precise and complete. Where its not possible, (for example
for code completion and where building is too slow), it uses Racer.

Since the Rust compiler does not yet support end-to-end incremental compilation,
we can't offer a perfect experience. However, by optimising our use of the
compiler and falling back to Racer, we can offer a pretty good experience for
small to medium sized crates. As the RLS and compiler evolve, we'll offer a
better experience for larger and larger crates.

The RLS is designed to be frontend-independent. We hope it will be widely
adopted by different editors and IDEs. To seed development, we provide a
[reference implementation of an RLS frontend](https://github.com/jonathandturner/rls_vscode)
for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


## Setup

**YOU NEED A VERY RECENT NIGHTLY COMPILER**

Otherwise the RLS will not work very well.

### Step 1: Clone and build the RLS

Since the RLS is closely linked to the compiler and is in active development,
you'll need a recent nightly compiler to build it.

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls.git
cd rls
cargo build --release
```

### Step 2: Connect the RLS to your compiler

If you're using recent versions of rustup, you will also need to make sure that
the compiler's dynamic libraries are available for the RLS to load. You can see
where they  are using:

```
rustc --print sysroot
```

This will show you where the compiler keeps the dynamic libs. In Windows, this
will be  in the `bin` directory under this path. On other platforms, it will be
in the `lib` directory.

Next, you'll make the compiler available to the RLS:

#### Windows

On Windows, make sure this path (plus `bin`) is in your PATH.  For example:

```
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\appveyor\.multirust\toolchains\nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu\bin
```

#### Mac

For Mac, you need to set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.  For example:

```
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/jturner/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib
```

#### Linux

For Linux, this path is called LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/jturner/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib
```

### Step 3: Set your RLS_ROOT 

Next, we'll set the RLS_ROOT environment variable to point to where we built
the RLS:

```
export RLS_ROOT=/Source/rls
```

### Step 4: Download standard library metadata

Finally, we need to get the metadata for the standard library.  This lets
us get additional docs and types for all of `std`.  The command is currently only 
supported on the nightly compilers, though we hope to remove this restriction in
the future.

```
rustup component add rust-analysis
```

If you've never set up Racer before, you may also need follow the [Racer configuration
steps](https://github.com/phildawes/racer#configuration)

_**Note:** in the future, we hope to move these setup steps to `rustup`, so that
you only have one step to add IDE support._

## Running

Though the RLS is built to work with many IDEs and editors, we currently use
VSCode to test the RLS (you can run the RLS manually with the `cargo run` command).

To run with VSCode, you'll need a 
[recent VSCode version](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.

Next, you'll need to run the VSCode extension (for this step, you'll need a
recent [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonathandturner/rls_vscode.git
cd rls_vscode
npm install
code .
```

VSCode will open into the `rls_vscode` project.  From here, click the Debug
button on the left-hand side (a bug with a line through it). Next, click the
green triangle at the top.  This will launch a new instance of VSCode with the
`rls_vscode` plugin enabled.  From there, you can open your Rust projects using
the RLS.

You'll know it's working when you see this in the status bar at the bottom, with
a spinning indicator:

`RLS analysis: working /`

Once you see:

`RLS analysis: done`

Then you have the full set of capabilities available to you.  You can goto def,
find all refs, rename, goto type, etc.  Completions are also available using the
heuristics that Racer provides.  As you type, your code will be checked and
error squiggles will be reported when errors occur.  You can hover these
squiggles to see the text of the error.

## Configuration

The RLS can be configured on a per-project basis by adding a file called
`rls.toml` to the project root (i.e., next to Cargo.toml). Entries in this file
will affect how the RLS operates and how it builds your project.

Currently we accept the following options:

* `build_lib` (`bool`, defaults to `false`) checks the project as if you passed
  the `--lib` argument to cargo.
* `cfg_test` (`bool`, defaults to `true`) checks the project as if you were
  running `cargo test` rather than `cargo build`. I.e., compiles (but does not
  run) test code.
